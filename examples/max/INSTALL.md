# Installing live coding extensions

## Download the models

The plugins expect models to be downloaded into ~/Documents/Magenta/

Do one of the following:

* Use the built-in model downloader in the other MRT2 apps (Jam, Collider, or the AU Plugin) [here](http://g.co/magenta/mrt2).
* Download manually with the installer from the GitHub repo.

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/metaneutrons/magenta-realtime.git
cd magenta-realtime
uv sync --extra mlx
uv run mrt models init
uv run mrt models download
```


## Install


### MaxMSP

Copy `mrt2~.mxo` into a directory Max searches. The simplest place is
`~/Documents/Max 9/Library/` (or `Max 8` if you're on the older version):

```sh
ditto max "$HOME/Documents/Max 9/Library/mrt2~"
```

Open `max/mrt2~.maxhelp` for example usage.


### PureData

Pd looks for externals in its search paths (Preferences → Path). The simplest
install puts the external + its metallib + help patch into a `mrt2~/`
subdirectory under your user externals folder:

```sh
ditto pd "$HOME/Documents/Pd/externals/mrt2~"
```

Open `pd/mrt2~-help.pd` for example usage


### SuperCollider

SuperCollider scans `~/Library/Application Support/SuperCollider/Extensions`
recursively at server boot. The simplest install drops the binary + metallib +
sclang class + example into a `MRT2/` subdirectory there:

```sh
ditto sc "$HOME/Library/Application Support/SuperCollider/Extensions/MRT2"
```

Open `sc/example.scd` for example usage.

After installing, recompile the sclang class library (Language → Recompile
Class Library, or `Cmd-Shift-L`). `mlx.metallib` must remain next to
`MRT2.scx` — MLX uses `dladdr` to locate its kernels at runtime.
